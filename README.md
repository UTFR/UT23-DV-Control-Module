# UT23 Driverless Control Module v.1.1

By: Muaz Shash, Drivierless Team Member, University of Toronto Formula Racing Team

With the start of the 2023 Formula Student season, the University of Toronto Formula Racing Team (UTFR) has established an all new department: Drivierless, a team responsible for developing an autonomous system that can operate our vehicle to score even more points at competition and secure our spot on the podium. And like all other systems in our car, driverless also requires an electronic controller to interface with the real world. The driverless controller is responsible for all the critical control and safety decisions related to autonomous tasks such as controlling visual and audial system status indicators, stepping up/down voltages, managing if and when power is delivered to steering, braking and throttle, as well as communicating with the rest of the car and its electric system over multiple CAN Busses.

The Driverless Control Module includes many different components such as a Teensy 4.1, two CAN transceivers, a 12V switching regulator, a 5V linear regulators, a 3V3 linear regulator and a series of relays and MOSfet circuits. In this article, I will provide a high level overview of how the driverless controller manages power and responds to autonomous commands.

## Schematic Design

The driverless control module distributes 4 voltage levels: 14.8V, 12V, 5V, and 3.3V. The 14.8V comes straight from the battery and is intended for brakes and steering as well as the shutdown circuit. The 12V is distributed to the system status indicator LEDs and speaker, the 5V is for the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller, and the 3.3V is for the CAN transcievers. You may also notice that there are plenty of LEDs and testing points. These are purely for debugging during testing and serve no other purpose.

The controller features many mosfets and relays to control power. The vehicle features a shutdown circuit (SDC) that essentially disables the car from moving if any point in the SDC has been opened. On the DV controller, this corresponds to the wires in blue. If the 3.3V Autonomous System enable (AS_EN) signal controlling the mosfet is low, the vehicle will never be able to move. If the 14.8V Autonomous System Master Switch (ASMS) is high, then this implies we are in autonomous driving mode and require the Remote Emergency Stop (RES) which can be controlled wireless to be closed. If the ASMS is low, then this implies we are in manual driving mode and we can bypass the Remote Emergency Stop. The ASMS, also controls whether power can be delivered to the brakes and steering motors. All this is done using a force-guided contacts relay to prevent the possibility of the autonomous system taking over during manual driving.

The UTFR team uses the Teensy 4.1 microcontroler that boasts a 600 Mhz ARM processor and 3 CAN bus channels. The Teensy is responsible for managing the vehicle start and steering relays using the mosfets in the image above, controlling the steering and brake over pwm, communicating over CAN to the RES and the rest of the car's electrical system and controlling autonomous status system indicators (ASSI). The ASSI are a speaker and RGB strips located around the car. The Teensy generates a square wave signal to control the speaker and pulls theblue/green/red pins low to make the RGB strips flash blue or yellow.

In addition to simply sending out signals, the Teensy is programmed to monitor all of its signals to provide adaptive feedback. We constantly monitor the battery voltage to avoid loading too much stress to the battery and low voltage system throughout the car, we check brake voltage to see if autonomous braking is possible and brake pressure to see how hard we're pressing the brakes, and we read how much current is flowing through the autonomous system indicators to confirm the signal was sent and the connection is stable. Due to its robustness to noise, we also use the sensor CAN bus to read safety critical sensor data collected from other parts of the car. Shown below is the UT23 CAN architecture diagram.

The Driverless Control Module is a four-layer board designed using Altium Designer. The four layers include a high-frequency digital signal and power top layer, a power and ground second layer, a grounded third layer, and an analog and low-frequency signal bottom layer. Differential signals were routed near each other, and other high-frequency signals were routed in a manner that considered adequate spacing and reducing trace length. A substantial effort was placed in making a user-friendly silkscreen to ensure the correct and safe fabrication, assembly and operation of the board.
